## Side note

The file `local.properties` is empty as it should contain the path to the SDK on your computer.

Edit this file and add the following line; replace with your username:

For Mac
```
sdk.dir=/Users/{your_user_name}/Library/Android/sdk
```

For Windows:
```
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\{your_user_name}\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```
